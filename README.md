U.S. Hospital Star Ratings Analysis (2016-2020) 
A comprehensive state-by-state analysis of U.S. hospital performance using CMS Hospital Compare data. This Excel-based study reveals dramatic geographic disparities in hospital quality across 25,082 Medicare-certified hospitals.
Key Findings
Geographic Performance Champions

Massachusetts leads the nation: 43.2% of hospitals above national average
Northeast dominance: MA, NJ, CT occupy top 3 positions
Massive state disparities: 43.2% (MA) vs 0% (9 states)

Critical National Statistics

Total Hospitals Analyzed: 25,082 across all 50 states + territories
Data Timeframe: 2016-2020 CMS Hospital Compare data
Above National Average: Only 7.8% of hospitals (1,954)
Performance Data Gap: 32% of hospitals lack mortality comparisons

States Requiring Urgent Attention
Nine states have ZERO hospitals performing above national average on mortality:

Utah, Puerto Rico, Oregon, New Mexico, Montana, Maine, Hawaii, Arkansas, Alaska

Key Limitation: 32% missing mortality comparison data

Analysis Approach

Data Validation: Systematic missing value analysis across 29 variables
Geographic Aggregation: State-level performance summaries
Benchmark Comparison: National average mortality performance
Trend Analysis: Multi-year hospital performance tracking

Performance Metrics Analyzed

Mortality National Comparison (primary focus)
Safety of Care performance
Readmission Rates comparison
Patient Experience scores
Overall Star Ratings (1-5 scale)

Healthcare Policy Implications
Immediate Actions Needed

Federal Intervention: Target zero-performer states with quality improvement programs
Resource Reallocation: Increase Medicare funding to underperforming regions
Best Practice Sharing: Massachusetts model implementation nationwide
Data Collection: Address 32% missing mortality data crisis

Regional Patterns Discovered

Northeast Excellence: Consistent top performance across New England
Western Struggles: Multiple western states underperform
Rural Challenges: Smaller states show lower performance rates
Population Density Effect: Urban states generally outperform rural states

Business Applications
For Healthcare Consumers

Hospital Selection: Use state rankings for relocation decisions

Quality Deserts: Nine states with zero above-average hospitals
Northeast Advantage: Consistent regional outperformance
Data Transparency Crisis: One-third of hospitals lack performance data

Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
For Patients: Location dramatically impacts healthcare quality - state choice matters for health outcomes.
For Hospitals: Geographic clustering suggests systemic factors beyond individual hospital control.
For Policymakers: Federal intervention needed to address massive interstate quality disparities.
For Researchers: Rich dataset enables numerous healthcare quality research directions.

This analysis demonstrates how large-scale healthcare data can reveal critical patterns in national health system performance, providing actionable insights for improving patient care across America.
