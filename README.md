## üî¨ Analysis Methodology

### Data Source & Quality
- **Source:** CMS Hospital Compare Program (2016-2020)
- **Coverage:** 25,082 Medicare-certified hospitals
- **Scope:** All 50 states plus U.S. territories
- **Data Completeness:** High (most variables 100% complete)
- **Key Limitation:** 32% missing mortality comparison data

### Analysis Approach
1. **Data Validation:** Systematic missing value analysis across 29 variables
2. **Geographic Aggregation:** State-level performance summaries
3. **Benchmark Comparison:** National average mortality performance
4. **Trend Analysis:** Multi-year hospital performance tracking

### Performance Metrics Analyzed
- **Mortality National Comparison** (primary focus)
- **Safety of Care** performance
- **Readmission Rates** comparison
- **Patient Experience** scores
- **Overall Star Ratings** (1-5 scale)

## üè• Healthcare Policy Implications

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Federal Intervention:** Target zero-performer states with quality improvement programs
2. **Resource Reallocation:** Increase Medicare funding to underperforming regions
3. **Best Practice Sharing:** Massachusetts model implementation nationwide
4. **Data Collection:** Address 32% missing mortality data crisis

### Regional Patterns Discovered
- **Northeast Excellence:** Consistent top performance across New England
- **Western Struggles:** Multiple western states underperform
- **Rural Challenges:** Smaller states show lower performance rates
- **Population Density Effect:** Urban states generally outperform rural states
